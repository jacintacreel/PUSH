# PUSH
PUSH (Program for the Uncertainty in the Search for Habitability)
PUSH (Program for the Uncertainty in the Search for Habitability) has as its goal to output a list of potential candidates that could reside in a habitable zone for life. The way to do this involves uncertainty and constraints. For more information, see the [main project] * insert link to SPROJ. 

# Quick Start

PUSH runs best when used on Jupiter Notebook. 
### Installing PUSH locally

1. Download Anaconda (if you do not have it yet) and make sure you have the latest version of it.

2. Open a Jupiter Notebook and make sure it is activate. 

3.  Installing Dependencies  (libraries other than the project code that are required to create and run your application)
You might run into errors or issues while installing dependencies. In that case, install each library needed manually with ‘pip install’. 

	Ex: ‘pip install ipywidgets’
	Note: this is done directly in the terminal and not in the Notebook. In the notebook make sure you are including the package as ‘import ipywidgets as widgets’

4. Download the repository. 

5. Download the two main Data Sets as ‘csv’ files. 

## Getting started

The easiest way to use PUSH is to try any constraints!
